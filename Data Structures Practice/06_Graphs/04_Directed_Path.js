/*
Given two nodes (start and dest) in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), return true if there is a directed path from start to dest, otherwise return false.

Example 1:

Input: start = 1, dest = 3
Output: true
Explanation: There is a directed path 1 -> 2 -> 3.
Example 2:

Input: start = 1, dest = 4
Output: false
Explanation: There is no path from 1 to 4.
